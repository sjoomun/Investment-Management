    "# 2. Optimal asset allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have decided on a set of N risky assets that you are willing to invest in. Call these assets 1, 2, ..., N. The goal of optimal asset allocation is to tell you what weight you should put in each of these risky assets, and what weight you should put in a risk-free asset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Find the tangency portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous lecture that, given your N risky assets, the weights that give us the portolio with the highest Sharpe ratio are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{W_{tan}} = \\frac{ \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{\\mu^e} }{ \\mathbf{1^{T}}\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathbf{\\mu^e} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}$ is the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the N assets, and $\\mathbf{\\mu}^e$ is the vector of risk premia on your N assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $\\mathbf{W_{tan}}$ is a vector of numbers, not a single number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{W_{tan}} = \\begin{pmatrix} w_{1,tan} \\\\ w_{2,tan} \\\\ ... \\\\ w_{N,tan} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each element $w_{i,tan}$ gives us the weight of risky asset $i$ inside the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Find the optimal capital allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw two lectures ago that, if we have decided to invest in some risky portfolio P and the risk-free asset, the optimal weight in the risky asset is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{oca} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_{P}^2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Combine the first two steps to obtain the optimal asset allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The risky portfolio $P$ in the above formula is our tangency portfolio from Step 1. So, in order to apply the above formula, we need to know not only the risk aversion of the investor ($A$), but also the expected return and variance of the tangency portfolio ($E[R_P]$ and $\\sigma_{P}^2$). This is straightforward, since we already know the weights of each asset inside the tangency portfolio from Step 1 ($\\mathbf{W_{tan}}$). Using the matrix notation above, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[R_P] - R_f = \\mathbf{W_{tan}}^{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\mu^e}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{P}^2 = \\mathbf{W_{tan}}^{T} \\cdot  \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\cdot  \\mathbf{W_{tan}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the $T$ superscript in $\\mathbf{W_{tan}}^{T}$ stands for \"transpose\" which means reshaping the N x 1 vector $\\mathbf{W_{tan}}$ into a 1 x N vector: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{W_{tan}}^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} w_{1,tan} & w_{2,tan} & ...& w_{N,tan} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the optimal capital allocation weight $w_{oca}$ and the tangency portfolio weights $\\mathbf{W_{tan}}$, the optimal asset allocation involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting $1 - w_{oca}$ of your funds in the risk-free asset\n",
    "- Putting $w_{oca} \\cdot w_{i,tan}$ of your finds in each risky asset $i$\n",
    "    - Where, as mentioned above, $w_{i,tan}$ is the weight of asset $i$ inside the tangency portfolio (the $i^{th}$ element of the $\\mathbf{W_{tan}}$ vector) "

    "# 3. Special case: two risky assets\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formulas apply for any arbitrary number of risky assets N. However, to build intuition, here, we provide the formulas for the special case when we have only N = 2 risky assets. This special case is actually very important because your risky assets don't have to be individual assets (e.g. FB or TSLA). They can be portfolios. For example, one of your risky assets may be the S\\&P500 (e.g. an ETF like SPY which tracks the S\\&P500) and the other risky asset may be a diversified bond portfolio (e.g. an ETF like BND from Vanguard). In this case, solving for the optimal asset allocation decision is equivalent to deciding the optimal proportion of your funds to invest in stocks, bonds, and cash (or cash-equivalent assets). This is a very important investment decision, one that you will have to make very soon, for example, when you set up your 401(K). \n",
